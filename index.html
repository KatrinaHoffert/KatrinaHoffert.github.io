      <h1>A bit about me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a programmer who's always been drawn to technology from a young age. I enjoy solving
        rewarding problems and coming up with solutions that are as pleasing as possible. I find
        well written code to be beautiful, and make that a goal with the things that I create.
      </p>
      <p>
        My area of most experience is in full stack web dev, where I have a great depth of experience
        in dealing with everything from the database to the backend software and all the way up to the
        front end, where I have an eye for design. I'm experienced with creating sites that are
        responsive and secure. I pride myself in being up-to-date in web technologies and security
        best practices.
